*None currently identified.*

### Low Priority / Nice-to-Have
*None currently identified.*

### ✅ Fixed Issues

#### Production Issues (All Fixed: 2025-12-07)

- [CRITICAL] Black screens in production (discovered: 2025-12-07, **FIXED: 2025-12-07**)
  - Impact: App showed black screen in production, all API calls blocked
  - Root Cause: CSP headers in `vercel.json` blocked `api.airtable.com` and other required domains
  - Solution: Updated `vercel.json` Content-Security-Policy to include all required domains
  - Location: `vercel.json:8` - Added `https://api.airtable.com`, `https://*.airtable.com`, proper `img-src`, `media-src`
  - Commit: `d39bb8f`
  - Verified: ✅ All API calls successful in production

- [HIGH] Scanner infinite loop - continuous item additions (discovered: 2025-12-07, **FIXED: 2025-12-07**)
  - Impact: Scanning once added items multiple times, phone vibrated continuously
  - Root Cause: Scanner restarted on every render due to `onScanSuccess` in useEffect dependencies
  - Solution: Implemented ref-based callback pattern + 2-second debounce to prevent duplicate scans
  - Location: `src/components/scanner/Scanner.tsx:13-93`
  - Commit: `968933d`
  - Verified: ✅ Single scan per barcode, no duplicates

- [HIGH] PWA chunk load failures after deployment (discovered: 2025-12-07, **FIXED: 2025-12-07**)
  - Impact: Black screen in production with "ChunkLoadError: Loading chunk X failed"
  - Root Cause: Service worker caching old JavaScript chunks, new deployment had different filenames
  - Solution: Added lazy import retry mechanism (3 retries + reload) + workbox config (`skipWaiting`, `clientsClaim`, `cleanupOutdatedCaches`)
  - Location: `src/App.tsx:11-34`, `vite.config.ts:81-86`
  - Commits: `5785aa1`, `968933d`
  - Verified: ✅ Smooth deployments, automatic chunk updates

- [HIGH] Scanner active during modal interaction (discovered: 2025-12-07, **FIXED: 2025-12-07**)
  - Impact: Scanner ran while add/remove modal open, phone vibrated during interaction
  - Root Cause: Scanner hidden with CSS but still mounted and running
  - Solution: Changed from CSS hiding to conditional rendering (unmounting)
  - Location: `src/pages/ScanPage.tsx:101-160, 197-255`
  - Commit: `0e4e5f1`
  - Verified: ✅ Scanner stops when modal opens

- [HIGH] Checkout infinite loop on non-existent products (discovered: 2025-12-07, **FIXED: 2025-12-07**)
  - Impact: Scanning non-existent product in checkout caused infinite loop, no feedback
  - Root Cause: Missing handling for `!isLoading && !product && !error` case
  - Solution: Added explicit "product not found" case with error message
  - Location: `src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx:301-310`
  - Commit: `0e4e5f1`
  - Verified: ✅ Clear error message shown, no loop

- [MEDIUM] Mobile checkout scanner always active (discovered: 2025-12-07, **FIXED: 2025-12-07**)
  - Impact: Scanner active even when cart panel expanded on mobile
  - Root Cause: Scanner always rendered regardless of cart state
  - Solution: Conditional rendering based on `!state.isCartExpanded` + auto-collapse cart after scan
  - Location: `src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx:518-533, 298-300`
  - Commit: `96437d2`
  - Verified: ✅ Scanner stops when cart expanded, auto-collapses after scan

- [LOW] Transparent dialog background (discovered: 2025-12-07, **FIXED: 2025-12-07**)
  - Impact: Confirmation dialog showed camera feed through background
  - Root Cause: `bg-background` CSS variable undefined in `index.css`
  - Solution: Changed to explicit `bg-white border border-stone-200`
  - Location: `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx:40`
  - Commit: `413bb9f`
  - Verified: ✅ Solid white background

#### Earlier Fixes

- [HIGH] Stock Movement History not displaying (discovered: 2025-12-07, **FIXED: 2025-12-07**)
  - Impact: Users could not see recent stock movements in Product Detail view
  - Root Cause: Airtable's `filterByFormula` doesn't work reliably with linked record fields
  - Solution: Fetch recent records and filter client-side in JavaScript using `Array.includes()`
  - Location: `src/lib/api.ts:337-380` - `getStockMovements()` function
  - Verified: ✅ All 5 test movements now displaying correctly in UI

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Week 1 Goal (User Validation)
**Target**: 1+ users scan at least 5 products on 3+ different days

**Tracking**:
- User count: TBD
- Products scanned: TBD
- Days active: TBD
- Check date: 2025-12-12

---

## 🔄 Testing Workflow (Follow These Steps)

### 1. Start Server
```bash
./init.sh
```
This will:
- Check environment setup
- Verify dependencies
- Run TypeScript validation
- Build for production
- Start dev server on http://localhost:5173

### 2. Test with Playwright MCP
Open new terminal and use Claude Code with prompts like:
```
"Test barcode scanning at http://localhost:5173"
"Test creating a new product with auto-fill"
"Test stock IN and OUT movements"
```

### 3. Mark Tests Complete
After each test scenario passes:
1. Update `feature_list.json` → set `tested: true`
2. Update `claude-progress.md` → check off test scenario
3. Note any bugs in "Known Issues" section

### 4. Commit Changes
After testing is complete:
```bash
git add feature_list.json claude-progress.md
git commit -m "test: Complete testing for [feature name]"
```

### 5. Leave Project Merge-Ready
- All tests passing
- No uncommitted changes
- Feature working as expected
- Ready for deployment

---

## 📌 Important Notes

### ⚠️ File Modification Rules
1. **feature_list.json**:
   - ✅ ONLY mark features as `"implemented": true` and `"tested": true`
   - ❌ DO NOT remove or modify anything else

2. **claude-progress.md**:
   - ✅ Update testing status, sprint tracking, and activity log
   - ✅ Add bugs to "Known Issues" section
   - ❌ DO NOT remove historical entries

3. **After Testing**:
   - ✅ ALWAYS commit to git
   - ✅ ALWAYS ensure project is merge-ready
   - ✅ ALWAYS use Playwright MCP for testing

### 🎯 Testing Philosophy
- Test features immediately after implementation
- Use Playwright MCP for automated browser testing
- Commit after each successful test
- Leave project in deployable state
